### About me

I'm currently an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/departamentos/dei) of [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt), and a Senior Researcher at [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt), working with the [Group on Artificial Intelligence for People and Society](http://gaips.inesc-id.pt).

## Research

My main research interests are in _machine learning_ and _decision-theoretic planning_, and in the exploration of models and algorithms from these fields of AI that may enable the development of intelligent autonomous agents capable of interacting with other agents (human or artificial) in complex, possibly unknown environments. My research thus lies at the intersection of different sub-fields within artificial intelligence, such as decision-theoretic planning (and its applications to human-robot interaction and collaborative multi-agent scenarios), general reinforcement learning, active learning, and interactive machine learning.

### Research Interests:

* Machine learning (ML):
* Reinforcement learning
* Inverse reinforcement learning
* Active learning
* Online learning
* Robotic applications of ML
* Decision-theoretic planning (single and multiagent)
