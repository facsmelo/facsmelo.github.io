## Welcome to my personal homepage

I'm currently an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/departamentos/dei) of [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt), and a Senior Researcher at [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt), working with the [Group on Artificial Intelligence for People and Society](http://gaips.inesc-id.pt).

My main research interests are in _machine learning_ and _decision-theoretic planning_, and in the exploration of models and algorithms from these fields of AI that may enable the development of intelligent autonomous agents capable of interacting with other agents (human or artificial) in complex, possibly unknown environments. My research thus lies at the intersection of different sub-fields within artificial intelligence, such as decision-theoretic planning (and its applications to human-robot interaction and collaborative multi-agent scenarios), general reinforcement learning, active learning, and interactive machine learning.

### Research Interests:

* Reinforcement learning
* Machine learning for robotics
* Planning under uncertainty
* Artificial intelligence

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/facsmelo/facsmelo.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
